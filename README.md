By leveraging data analytics, the goal is to optimize engagement and maximize the impact of promotional efforts within the music streaming industry.

# Key Findings
1. Conversion Rate Analysis for Advertisement Targeting
Insight: Analyzing the conversion rate of advertisements reveals significant opportunities for optimization.

Observation: Some artists exhibit lower conversion rates, indicating that they are not reaching their full potential audience.
Recommendation: Increase advertisement efforts for these artists to improve their visibility and attract more listeners. This can involve targeted campaigns that highlight these artists on various platforms.
